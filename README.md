The Art of Obfuscating Android Payloads  
**What does this script do?  
**It has 4 options:  
**1)** Generates a simple MSF payload using MSFVENOM (no obfuscation)  
**2)** Takes an original app and injects MSF payload into it (Obfuscated)  
**3)** Generates a payload and changes default strings and icon. (Obfuscated)  
**4)** Generates a payload like option 3 and injects a new MainActivity for persistence after reboot. (Persistent, Obfuscated)
